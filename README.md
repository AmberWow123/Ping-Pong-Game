## Ping-Pong Game with a Twist
<p>
In this project, we are developing a two-player ping-pong game with additional feature such as smashing or spinning the ball.
    
As a normal ping-pong game, both players start with zero point, the first player reaching eleven point wins the game. Players serve two serves each, alternating. And if a game ties at 10-10, a player must win by 2 points. In this situation, players serve one serve each, alternating.
    
Each player can control a ping pong racket with keyboard keys. They are targeting to catch the ball and return it with the racket. If one fails to catch the ball, the other player scores.
    
Strategies below increase the chance to score:
- Smashing a ball means, in some circumstances, you can hit the ball harder to increase its speed. This gives your oppenent less time to react, and therefore more difficult to hit the ball back to you.

- Spinning the ball is to let the ball not go in a straight line, but in a curve. This makes the landing position harder to predict.
